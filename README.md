## Assignment
- Build a tic Tac Toe Game

### Requirements:
- Write as little global code as possible by tucking everything either in a **module** or a **factory**
- Write a function that renders the game board
- Write a function to allow players to place marks
- Don't allow players to click twice on the same spot
- Build the logic to check when the game is over
- Allow player to start/restart the game

## Learning outcomes from this project
- Getting familiar with **Module Pattern** & use of **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)** 
- Manipulation of classList/className with methods **contains()**, **remove()**, **replace()** 
- Trigger an addEventListener only once by adding the argument **{once: true}**

*Rule of thumb:* 
- Use a a **module** if just ONE of something is needed (e.g. gameBoard, displayController)
- Use a **factory** if we need to create multiple instances of something (e.g. players)

## How this project can be optimized
- Add an option to play against an AI
- Optimized the CSS for small screens/mobile
